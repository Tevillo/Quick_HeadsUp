A Song of Ice and Fire Heads up game

V0.1

install rust here [Rust Download](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Then run `rustup toolchain install stable`

`cargo build` will compile the program. Then run `cargo run` and it will start the program. The game works by generating 
a random prompt and then the user will say if they got it right or wrong by typing "y" for yes and anything else for pass.

BUGS:

Game won't check time left until guess is passed or passed.
